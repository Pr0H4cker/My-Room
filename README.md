# My-Room

This is literally just a render of a room I like. The tv is playing my advertisements, the walls have a picture of my face and a game I am making. It is a little blurry, and that is because of how small the thing is! Its just aesthetic, its not supposed to be an advert :)

### The reason why I made this was because I saw something quite simular to this on codepen, however it was all in spanish and was not working too good!
